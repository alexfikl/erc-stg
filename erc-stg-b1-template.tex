\section*{Part I of the Scientific Proposal (max. 5 pages, references
do not count towards the page limit)}
\label{sc:synopsis}

\begin{erccomment}
\textbf{Please note the changes as from 2026 calls regarding Part I and Part II
of the Scientific Proposal and read carefully the ``ERC Work Programme 2026``
and the ``Information for Applicants to the Starting and Consolidator Grant
2026 Calls''.}

\begin{erccomment}

[\textbf{Part I of the Scientific Proposal} should present the envisaged research
and it should:
\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
    \item lay out the current state of knowledge,
    \item explain the scientific question and the objectives of the project, and
    \item present the overall approach or research strategy to reach the goals
    of the project.
\end{itemize}

Part I should convince the evaluation Panel that it presents an original and
creative idea addressing an important question in the respective research
field(s). Furthermore, it should substantiate how the project will advance the
frontier of knowledge, and what contribution it will make to the research
field(s) i.e. what may be changed, opened, challenged or how the results of the
work will alter the current understanding of the field.

\textbf{At Step 1, only Part I and the Curriculum Vitae (CV) and Track Record
(see below) is assessed by the evaluation Panel}. It forms the basis for the
Panel’s decision whether it chooses to evaluate the proposal in the next step.
Therefore, all essential information must be covered in this section.

References to literature should also be included. Please use a reference style
that is commonly used in your discipline such as American Chemical Society
(ACS) style, American Medical Association (AMA) style, Modern Language
Association (MLA) style, etc. and that allows the evaluators to easily retrieve
each reference.

\textbf{Please respect the following formatting constraints: Times New Roman,
Arial or similar, at least font size 11, margin sizes (2.0 cm side and 1.5 cm
top and bottom), single line spacing.]}

\subsection*{RESEARCH ACHIEVEMENTS AND PEER RECOGNITION}
\label{ssc:cv:research}

\subsubsection*{Research Achievements}

\begin{erccomment}
[Provide a list of up to ten research outputs that demonstrate how you have
advanced knowledge in your field with an emphasis on more recent achievements,
such as publications, articles deposited in a publicly available preprint
server, books, book chapters, conference proceedings, data sets, software,
patents, licenses, standards, start-up businesses or any other research outputs
you deem relevant in relation to your research field and your project.

You may include a short, factual explanation of the significance of the
selected outputs, your role in producing each of them, and how they demonstrate
your capacity to successfully carry out your proposed project.]
\end{erccomment}

\subsubsection*{Peer Recognition}

\begin{erccomment}
[Provide a list of selected examples of significant recognition by your peers
if applicable, such as prizes, awards, fellowships, elected academy
memberships, invited presentations to major conferences or any other examples
of significant recognition you deem relevant in relation to your research field
and project.

You may include a short explanation of the significance of the listed examples.]
\end{erccomment}

\subsection*{ADDITIONAL INFORMATION}
\label{ssc:cv:additional_information}

\begin{erccomment}
[You may provide relevant additional information on your research career to
provide context to the evaluation panels when assessing your research
achievements and peer recognition as described above.]
\end{erccomment}

\subsubsection*{Career breaks, diverse career paths, and major life events}

\begin{erccomment}
[You may include a short factual explanation of career breaks or diverse career
paths such as secondments, volunteering, part-time work, time spent in
different sectors or the effects of major life events such as long term illness
as well as the effects of pandemic restrictions on research productivity.]
\end{erccomment}

\subsubsection*{Other contributions to the research community}

\begin{erccomment}
[You may include a list of particularly noteworthy contributions to the
research community you have made other than research achievements and peer
recognition and a short explanation of these contributions. The purpose of this
section is to allow the panels to take a more rounded view of your career and
achievements and to ensure that any additional responsibilities, commitments
and leadership roles that you have taken on beyond your individual research
activities are recognised and taken into account.]

\textbf{ [(for more information see ``Information for Applicants to the
Starting and Consolidator Grant 2026 Calls'')] }

\textbf{Do NOT split the sections and/or references in Part B1 and do NOT
upload them as separate documents. The peer reviewers will only receive one
single document for evaluation at Step 1. Hence, Part B1 should contain all
elements as explained in this template. If some parts of Part B1 are uploaded
in the submission system as separate attachments, the peer reviewers will not
have access to them.}
