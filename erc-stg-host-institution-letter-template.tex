The \erccomment{<<please fill in here the name of the legal entity that is associated

the Agreement be successfully concluded:}

The applicant legal entity (Host Institution) commits itself to ensure that the
action tasks described in Annex 1 of the Agreement are performed under the
guidance of the principal investigator who is expected to devote:
\begin{itemize}

    time in an EU Member State or Associated Country;

    \item in the case of a Consolidator Grant at least 40\% of her/his working
    time to the ERC-funded project (action) and spend at least 50\% of her/his
    working time in an EU Member State or Associated Country;

    \item in the case of an Advanced Grant at least 30\% of her/his working time
    to the ERC-funded project (action) and spend at least 50\% of her/his

    the action;

    \item take all measures to implement the principles set out in the Commission
    recommendation on the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of
    Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers\footnotemark --- in particular
    regarding working conditions, transparent recruitment processes based on
    merit and career development --- and ensure that the principal investigator,
    researchers and third parties involved in the action are aware of them;

    \footnotetext{
    \href{https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/am509774cee_en_e4.pdf}{

    European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of
    Researchers (OJ L 75, 22.3.2005, p. 67).}

    \item enter — before grant signature— into a Supplementary Agreement with
    the principal investigator, that specifies the obligation of the applicant
    legal entity to meet its obligations under the Agreement;

    \item provide the principal investigator with a copy of the signed Agreement;

    \item guarantee the principal investigator scientific independence, in
    particular for the:

    \begin{enumerate}[i),itemsep=-5pt,partopsep=-5pt]
        \item use of the budget to achieve the scientific objectives;
        \item authority to publish as senior author and invite as co-authors
        those who have contributed substantially to the work;
        \item preparation of scientific reports for the action;
        \item selection and supervision of the other team members, in line with
        the profiles needed to conduct the research and in accordance with the
        beneficiary's usual management practices;
        \item possibility to apply independently for funding;
        \item access to appropriate space and facilities for conducting the research;
    \end{enumerate}

    \item provide --- during the implementation of the action --- research
    support to the principal investigator and the team members (regarding
    infrastructure, equipment, access rights, products and other services
    necessary for conducting the research);

    \item support the principal investigator and provide administrative assistance,
    in particular for the:

    \begin{enumerate}[i),itemsep=-5pt,partopsep=-5pt]
        \item general management of the work and their team;
        \item scientific reporting, especially ensuring that the team members send
        their scientific results to the principal investigator;
        \item financial reporting, especially providing timely and clear financial
        information;
        \item application of the beneficiary's usual management practices;
        \item general logistics of the action;
        \item access to the electronic exchange system;
    \end{enumerate}

    \item inform the principal investigator immediately (in writing) of any
    events or circumstances likely to affect the Agreement;

    \item ensure that the principal investigator enjoys adequate:

        \item conditions for annual, sickness and parental leave;
        \item occupational health and safety standards;
        \item insurance under the general social security scheme, such as
        pension rights;
    \end{enumerate}

    \item allow the transfer of the Agreement to a new beneficiary, if
    requested by the principal investigator and provided that the objectives of
    the action remain achievable (portability; see Article 41 of the Agreement);

    \item respect the fundamental principle of research integrity and ensure
    that persons carrying out research tasks under the action follow the good
    research practices and refrain from the research integrity violations
    described in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity\footnotemark.
    If any such violations or allegations occur, verify and pursue them and bring
    them to the attention of the Agency.
