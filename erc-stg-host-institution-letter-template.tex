    merit and career development --- and ensure that the principal investigator,
    researchers and third parties involved in the action are aware of them;

    European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of
    Researchers (OJ L 75, 22.3.2005, p. 67).}

    the principal investigator, that specifies the obligation of the applicant
    legal entity to meet its obligations under the Agreement;

    \item provide the principal investigator with a copy of the signed Agreement;

    \item guarantee the principal investigator scientific independence, in

        \item access to appropriate space and facilities for conducting the research;
    \end{enumerate}

    \item provide --- during the implementation of the action --- research
    support to the principal investigator and the team members (regarding
    infrastructure, equipment, access rights, products and other services
    necessary for conducting the research);

    \item support the principal investigator and provide administrative assistance,
    in particular for the:

    \begin{enumerate}[i),itemsep=-5pt,partopsep=-5pt]
        \item general management of the work and their team;
        \item scientific reporting, especially ensuring that the team members send

        \item financial reporting, especially providing timely and clear financial
        information;
        \item application of the beneficiary's usual management practices;

        \item insurance under the general social security scheme, such as
        pension rights;
    \end{enumerate}

    \item allow the transfer of the Agreement to a new beneficiary, if
    requested by the principal investigator and provided that the objectives of
    the action remain achievable (portability; see Article 41 of the Agreement);

    \item \textbf{respect the fundamental principle of research integrity and ensure
    that persons carrying out research tasks under the action follow the good
    research practices and refrain from the research integrity violations
    described in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity\footnotemark[5].
    If any such violations or allegations occur, verify and pursue them and bring
    them to the attention of the Agency.}
